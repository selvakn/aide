## v1.10.0

### 🔒 Security

- **Clear new round of stdlib CVEs by pinning toolchain `go1.26.3`.**
  govulncheck flagged GO-2026-4982/4980/4971/4918 (template/html, net,
  net/http, plus a `golang.org/x/net` HTTP/2 transport infinite-loop)
  reachable via `secrets.Rotate` and `launcher.RuntimeDir.Cleanup` on
  the `go1.26.x` toolchain line. v1.9.1 cleared the equivalent wave
  for the `go1.25.x` line by bumping the `go` directive; this release
  adds an explicit `toolchain go1.26.3` so the patched stdlib is
  fetched automatically when building under 1.26.
- **Split SSH primitives out of the `git-remote` capability.** Previously,
  enabling `git-remote` (auto-detected from `.git/config` containing
  `[remote `) silently bundled `~/.ssh` read access, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`
  forwarding, and outbound port 22 — letting an agent push over SSH even
  when the `ssh` capability was not enabled, by leaning on the
  ssh-agent socket forwarded from the host. `git-remote` is now
  HTTPS-only (port 443 + git credential manager). Git-over-SSH requires
  explicit `--with ssh`. Mental model now matches reality: no `ssh`
  capability, no SSH push.

### ✨ New

- **`ssh` capability is now a first-class opt-in guard.** Owns
  `~/.ssh` reads, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` env passthrough, and outbound SSH
  ports. Use it for `git push`/`fetch` over SSH, `ssh` login,
  `scp`/`rsync` over SSH.
- **Custom SSH ports resolved from four channels** (deny-default;
  port 22 only allowed when SSH is actually in use):
  - `~/.ssh/config` — `Port` directives
  - `.git/config` — `ssh://user@host:PORT/...` remote URLs
  - `AIDE_SSH_PORTS` env (comma-separated; replaces auto-detected set)
  - `.aide.yaml` — `capabilities.ssh.ports: [2222, 2223]`
- **Discoverability hint.** When `git-remote` detects an SSH-style
  remote in `.git/config` but `ssh` is not enabled, the launch banner
  now shows: `💡 git-remote: detected SSH remote(s); enable the 'ssh'
  capability to push/fetch over SSH (aide cap enable ssh)`.
- **`MergedRegistry` now layers user-defined capabilities onto
  builtins** instead of replacing them — so `.aide.yaml` can extend
  `ssh` with `ports:` without re-declaring readables/env.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Context resolver: exact remote URL now beats recursive path glob.**
  A context bound to a unique remote URL was silently overridden by
  any catch-all `**` path glob covering the checkout. New tier
  `RemoteExact` (250) sits between `PathGlob` (200) and `PathExact`
  (300): an exact URL is a stronger identity signal than any directory
  catch-all, but a specific directory binding still wins. The banner
  now reports `exact remote match` so the matched signal is visible.
- **Context resolver: git remote URLs canonicalized across ssh/scp/https
  forms.** Patterns and the live remote are normalized to
  `host/org/repo` before comparison, so a rule written in one form
  matches a checkout cloned in another (ssh-scheme, scp-style, or
  https). Glob patterns are left untouched.
- **Launcher banner now propagates guard hints.** The discoverability
  hint above (and any future guard hint) was emitted into
  `GuardResult.Hints` but only `aide status` aggregated it. The launch
  banner skipped the copy, so users never saw hints when actually
  running `aide`. Fixed: launcher's `buildBannerData` now copies
  `g.Hints` into `SandboxInfo.Hints` like `aide status` does.

### ⚠️ Breaking

- Sessions that relied on `git-remote` to grant SSH access must now
  also enable the `ssh` capability. The first run after upgrade
  surfaces the hint above to make the migration discoverable.
